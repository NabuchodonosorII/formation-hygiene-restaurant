## Configuration

### Minimal configuration

Simply set the `site_name` and add the following lines to `mkdocs.yml` to enable the theme:

``` yaml hl_lines="2-5"
site_name: My site
site_url: https://mydomain.org/mysite
theme:
  name: material
```

The `site_url` setting is important for a number of reasons.
By default, MkDocs will assume that your site is hosted at the root of
your domain. This is not the case, for example, when [publishing to GitHub
pages] - unless you use a custom domain. Another reason is that some of the
plugins require the `site_url` to be set, so you should always do this.

  [publishing to GitHub pages]: publishing-your-site.md#github-pages
  [installation methods]: getting-started.md#installation

???+ tip "Recommended: [configuration validation and auto-complete]"

    In order to minimize friction and maximize productivity, Material for MkDocs
    provides its own [schema.json][^1] for `mkdocs.yml`. If your editor supports
    YAML schema validation, it's definitely recommended to set it up:

    === "Visual Studio Code"

        1.  Install [`vscode-yaml`][vscode-yaml] for YAML language support.
        2.  Add the schema under the `yaml.schemas` key in your user or
            workspace [`settings.json`][settings.json]:

            ``` json
            {
              "yaml.schemas": {
                "https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/schema.json": "mkdocs.yml"
              },
              "yaml.customTags": [ // (1)!
                "!ENV scalar",
                "!ENV sequence",
                "!relative scalar",
                "tag:yaml.org,2002:python/name:material.extensions.emoji.to_svg",
                "tag:yaml.org,2002:python/name:material.extensions.emoji.twemoji",
                "tag:yaml.org,2002:python/name:pymdownx.superfences.fence_code_format",
                "tag:yaml.org,2002:python/object/apply:pymdownx.slugs.slugify mapping"
              ]
            }
            ```

            1.  This setting is necessary if you plan to use [icons and emojis],
                or Visual Studio Code will show errors on certain lines.

    === "Other"

        1.  Ensure your editor of choice has support for YAML schema validation.
        2.  Add the following lines at the top of `mkdocs.yml`:

            ``` yaml
            # yaml-language-server: $schema=https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/schema.json
            ```

  [^1]:
    If you're a MkDocs plugin or Markdown extension author and your project
    works with Material for MkDocs, you're very much invited to contribute a
    schema for your [extension] or [plugin] as part of a pull request on GitHub.

## Templates

If you want to jump start a new project, you can use one of our growing
collection of templates:

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   :octicons-repo-template-24: &nbsp; __[Blog][blog-template]__

    ---

    Create a blog

-   :octicons-repo-template-24: &nbsp; __[Social cards][social-cards-template]__

    ---

    Create documentation with social cards

</div>

[blog-template]: https://github.com/mkdocs-material/create-blog
[social-cards-template]: https://github.com/mkdocs-material/create-social-cards

## Previewing as you write

MkDocs includes a live preview server, so you can preview your changes as you
write your documentation. The server will automatically rebuild the site upon
saving. Start it with:

``` sh
mkdocs serve # (1)!
```

1.  If you have a large documentation project, it might take minutes until
    MkDocs has rebuilt all pages for you to preview. If you're only interested
    in the current page, the [`--dirtyreload`][--dirtyreload] flag will make
    rebuilds much faster:

    ```
    mkdocs serve --dirtyreload
    ```

If you're running Material for MkDocs from within Docker, use:

=== "Unix, Powershell"

    ```
    docker run --rm -it -p 8000:8000 -v ${PWD}:/docs squidfunk/mkdocs-material
    ```

=== "Windows"

    ```
    docker run --rm -it -p 8000:8000 -v "%cd%":/docs squidfunk/mkdocs-material
    ```

Point your browser to [localhost:8000][live preview] and you should see:

[![Creating your site]][Creating your site]

  [--dirtyreload]: https://www.mkdocs.org/about/release-notes/#support-for-dirty-builds-990
  [live preview]: http://localhost:8000
  [Creating your site]: assets/screenshots/creating-your-site.png

## Building your site

When you're finished editing, you can build a static site from your Markdown
files with:

```
mkdocs build
```

If you're running Material for MkDocs from within Docker, use:

=== "Unix, Powershell"

    ```
    docker run --rm -it -v ${PWD}:/docs squidfunk/mkdocs-material build
    ```

=== "Windows"

    ```
    docker run --rm -it -v "%cd%":/docs squidfunk/mkdocs-material build
    ```

The contents of this directory make up your project documentation. There's no
need for operating a database or server, as it is completely self-contained.
The site can be hosted on [GitHub Pages], [GitLab Pages], a CDN of your choice
or your private web space.

  [GitHub Pages]: publishing-your-site.md#github-pages
  [GitLab pages]: publishing-your-site.md#gitlab-pages

If you intend to distribute your documentation as a set of files to be
read from a local filesystem rather than a web server (such as in a
`.zip` file), please read the notes about [building for offline
usage].

  [building for offline usage]: setup/building-for-offline-usage.md
  
  
# Customization

Project documentation is as diverse as the projects themselves and Material for
MkDocs is a great starting point for making it look beautiful. However, as you
write your documentation, you may reach a point where small adjustments are
necessary to preserve your brand's style.

## Adding assets

[MkDocs] provides several ways to customize a theme. In order to make a few
small tweaks to Material for MkDocs, you can just add CSS and JavaScript files to
the `docs` directory.

  [MkDocs]: https://www.mkdocs.org

### Additional CSS

If you want to tweak some colors or change the spacing of certain elements,
you can do this in a separate style sheet. The easiest way is by creating a
new style sheet file in the `docs` directory:

``` { .sh .no-copy }
.
├─ docs/
│  └─ stylesheets/
│     └─ extra.css
└─ mkdocs.yml
```

Then, add the following lines to `mkdocs.yml`:

``` yaml
extra_css:
  - stylesheets/extra.css
```

### Additional JavaScript

If you want to integrate another syntax highlighter or add some custom logic to
your theme, create a new JavaScript file in the `docs` directory:

``` { .sh .no-copy }
.
├─ docs/
│  └─ javascripts/
│     └─ extra.js
└─ mkdocs.yml
```

Then, add the following lines to `mkdocs.yml`:

``` yaml
extra_javascript:
  - javascripts/extra.js
```

??? tip "How to integrate with third-party JavaScript libraries"

    It is likely that you will want to run your JavaScript code only
    once the page has been fully loaded by the browser. This means
    installing a callback function subscribing to events on the
    `document$` observable exported by Material for MkDocs.
    Using the `document$` observable is particularly important if you
    are using [instant loading] since it will not result in a page
    refresh in the browser - but subscribers on the observable will be
    notified.

    ``` javascript
    document$.subscribe(function() {
      console.log("Initialize third-party libraries here")
    })
    ```

    `document$` is an [RxJS Observable] and you can call the `subscribe()`
    method any number of times to attach different functionality.

  [instant loading]: setup/setting-up-navigation.md/#instant-loading
  [RxJS Observable]: https://rxjs.dev/api/index/class/Observable

## Extending the theme

If you want to alter the HTML source (e.g. add or remove some parts), you can
extend the theme. MkDocs supports [theme extension], an easy way to override
parts of Material for MkDocs without forking from git. This ensures that you
can update to the latest version more easily.

  [theme extension]: https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/customizing-your-theme/#using-the-theme-custom_dir

### Setup and theme structure

Enable Material for MkDocs as usual in `mkdocs.yml`, and create a new folder
for `overrides` which you then reference using the [`custom_dir`][custom_dir]
setting:

``` yaml
theme:
  name: material
  custom_dir: overrides
```

!!! warning "Theme extension prerequisites"

    As the [`custom_dir`][custom_dir] setting is used for the theme extension
    process, Material for MkDocs needs to be installed via `pip` and referenced
    with the [`name`][name] setting in `mkdocs.yml`. It will not work when
    cloning from `git`.

The structure in the `overrides` directory must mirror the directory structure
of the original theme, as any file in the `overrides` directory will replace the
file with the same name which is part of the original theme. Besides, further
assets may also be put in the `overrides` directory:

``` { .sh .no-copy }
.
├─ .icons/                             # Bundled icon sets
├─ assets/
│  ├─ images/                          # Images and icons

```

  [custom_dir]: https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/configuration/#custom_dir
  [name]: https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/configuration/#name

### Overriding partials

In order to override a partial, we can replace it with a file of the same name
and location in the `overrides` directory. For example, to replace the original
`footer.html` partial, create a new `footer.html` partial in the `overrides`
directory:

``` { .sh .no-copy }
.
├─ overrides/
│  └─ partials/
│     └─ footer.html
└─ mkdocs.yml
```

MkDocs will now use the new partial when rendering the theme. This can be done
with any file.

### Overriding blocks <small>recommended</small> { #overriding-blocks data-toc-label="Overriding blocks" }

Besides overriding partials, it's also possible to override (and extend)
template blocks, which are defined inside the templates and wrap specific
features. In order to set up block overrides, create a `main.html` file inside
the `overrides` directory:

``` { .sh .no-copy }
.
├─ overrides/
│  └─ main.html
└─ mkdocs.yml
```

Then, e.g. to override the site title, add the following lines to `main.html`:

``` html
{% extends "base.html" %}

{% block htmltitle %}
  <title>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet</title>
{% endblock %}
```

If you intend to __add__ something to a block rather than to replace it
altogether with new content, use `{{ super() }}` inside the block to include the
original block content. This is particularly useful when adding third-party
scripts to your docs, e.g.

``` html
{% extends "base.html" %}

{% block scripts %}
  <!-- Add scripts that need to run before here -->
  {{ super() }}
  <!-- Add scripts that need to run afterwards here -->
{% endblock %}
```

The following template blocks are provided by the theme:

| Block name        | Purpose                                         |
| :---------------- | :---------------------------------------------- |
| `analytics`       | Wraps the Google Analytics integration          |
| `announce`        | Wraps the announcement bar                      |
| `config`          | Wraps the JavaScript application config         |
| `container`       | Wraps the main content container                |
| `content`         | Wraps the main content                          |
| `extrahead`       | Empty block to add custom meta tags             |
| `fonts`           | Wraps the font definitions                      |
| `footer`          | Wraps the footer with navigation and copyright  |
| `header`          | Wraps the fixed header bar                      |
| `hero`            | Wraps the hero teaser (if available)            |
| `htmltitle`       | Wraps the `<title>` tag                         |
| `libs`            | Wraps the JavaScript libraries (header)         |
| `outdated`        | Wraps the version warning                       |
| `scripts`         | Wraps the JavaScript application (footer)       |
| `site_meta`       | Wraps the meta tags in the document head        |
| `site_nav`        | Wraps the site navigation and table of contents |
| `styles`          | Wraps the style sheets (also extra sources)     |
| `tabs`            | Wraps the tabs navigation (if available)        |

## Theme development

Material for MkDocs is built on top of [TypeScript], [RxJS] and [SASS], and
uses a lean, custom build process to put everything together.[^1] If you want
to make more fundamental changes, it may be necessary to make the adjustments
directly in the source of the theme and recompile it.

  [^1]:
    Prior to <!-- md:version 7.0.0 --> the build was based on Webpack, resulting
    in occasional broken builds due to incompatibilities with loaders and
    plugins. Therefore, we decided to swap Webpack for a leaner solution which
    is now based on [RxJS] as the application itself. This allowed for the
    pruning of more than 500 dependencies (~30% less).

  [TypeScript]: https://www.typescriptlang.org/
  [RxJS]: https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs
  [SASS]: https://sass-lang.com

### Environment setup

First, clone the repository for the edition you want to work on. If
you want to clone the Insiders repository, you need to become a
sponsor first to gain access.

  [Insiders]: insiders/index.md

=== "Material for MkDocs"

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material
    cd mkdocs-material
    ```

=== "Insiders"

    You will need to have a GitHub access token [as described in the
    Insiders documentation] and make it available in the `$GH_TOKEN`
    variable.

    ``` sh
    git clone https://${GH_TOKEN}@github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material-insiders.git # (1)!
    ```

    1.  If you are using SSH keys for authenticating with GitHub, you can
        clone Insiders with this command:

        ```
        git clone git@github.com:squidfunk/mkdocs-material-insiders.git
        ```

    [as described in the Insiders documentation]: insiders/getting-started.md#requirements

Next, create a new [Python virtual environment][venv] and
[activate][venv-activate] it:

```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

!!! note "Ensure pip always runs in a virtual environment"

    If you set the environment variable `PIP_REQUIRE_VIRTUALENV` to
    `true`, `pip` will refuse to install anything outside a virtual
    environment. Forgetting to activate a `venv` can be very annoying
    as it will install all sorts of things outside virtual
    environments over time, possibly leading to further errors. So,
    you may want to add this to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` and
    re-start your shell:

    ```
    export PIP_REQUIRE_VIRTUALENV=true
    ```

  [venv]: https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html
  [venv-activate]: https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#how-venvs-work

Then, install all Python dependencies:

=== "Material for MkDocs"

    ```
    pip install -e ".[recommended]"
    pip install nodeenv
    ```

=== "Insiders"

    ```
    pip install -e ".[recommended, imaging]"
    pip install nodeenv
    ```

    In addition, you will need to install the `cairo` and `pngquant` libraries in your
    system, as described in the [image processing] requirements guide.

    [image processing]: plugins/requirements/image-processing.md


Finally, install the [Node.js] LTS version into the Python virtual environment
and install all Node.js dependencies:

```
nodeenv -p -n lts
npm install
```

  [Node.js]: https://nodejs.org

### Development mode

Start the watcher with:

```
npm start
```

Then, in a second terminal window, start the MkDocs live preview server with:

```
mkdocs serve --watch-theme
```

Point your browser to [localhost:8000][live preview] and you should see this
very documentation in front of you.

!!! warning "Automatically generated files"

    Never make any changes in the `material` directory, as the contents of this
    directory are automatically generated from the `src` directory and will be
    overwritten when the theme is built.

  [live preview]: http://localhost:8000

### Building the theme

When you're finished making your changes, you can build the theme by invoking:

``` sh
npm run build # (1)!
```

1.  While this command will build all theme files, it will skip the overrides
    used in Material for MkDocs' own documentation which are not distributed
    with the theme. If you forked the theme and want to build the overrides
    as well, e.g. before submitting a PR with changes, use:

    ```
    npm run build:all
    ```
    
    
# Setup

Material for MkDocs offers a wide range of options for customizing your
documentation. In this section, we will explain how you can create a meaningful
structure for your site, change the look and feel, add a blog and comment system,
and build a highly optimized site.

## Site structure

Set up and customize the structure of your documentation by configuring the
header and footer to your taste, choosing among many modes of navigation,
setting up site search, and more.

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

## Content

Create a blog, integrate a comment system, connect a git repository, and set up
versioned documentation that matches your project's versioning methodology.

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

- :material-book-open-outline: __[Blog]__ – Set up a standalone blog or host it alongside your documentation
- :material-comment-text-outline: __[Comment System]__ – Add a third-party comment system on any page or footer
- :octicons-versions-16: __[Versioning]__ – Deploy multiple versions by integrating with external utilities
- :octicons-repo-16: __[Repository]__ – Connect your documentation to your git repository

  [Comment System]: adding-a-comment-system.md
  [Versioning]: setting-up-versioning.md
  [Repository]: adding-a-git-repository.md

## Optimization

Add site analytics and build an optimized site by adding automatic image
compression, complying with GDPR data privacy regulations, and making it
offline-capable.

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

- :material-google-analytics: __[Site analytics]__ – Learn how your users experience your documentation
- :material-screwdriver: __[Optimized site]__ – Create optimized sites that rank great on search engines
- :octicons-lock-16: __[Data Privacy]__ – Ensure compliance with data privacy regulations
- :octicons-cloud-offline-16: __[Offline usage]__ – Build an online and offline-capable documentation

</div>

  [Site analytics]: setting-up-site-analytics.md
  [Optimized site]: building-an-optimized-site.md
  [Data Privacy]: ensuring-data-privacy.md
  [Offline usage]: building-for-offline-usage.md
  

  

    This will take longer, as now the icon search index, schema files, as
    well as additional style sheet and JavaScript files are built.

This triggers the production-level compilation and minification of all style
sheets and JavaScript files. After the command exits, the compiled files are
located in the `material` directory. When running `mkdocs build`, you should
now see your changes to the original theme.

# Setting up the header

Material for MkDocs' header can be customized to show an announcement bar that
disappears upon scrolling, and provides some options for further configuration.
It also includes the [search bar] and a place to display your project's
[git repository], as explained in those dedicated guides.

  [search bar]: setting-up-site-search.md
  [git repository]: adding-a-git-repository.md

## Configuration

### Automatic hiding

<!-- md:version 6.2.0 -->
<!-- md:feature -->

When autohiding is enabled, the header is automatically hidden when the
user scrolls past a certain threshold, leaving more space for content. Add the
following lines to `mkdocs.yml`:

``` yaml
theme:
  features:
    - header.autohide
```

### Announcement bar

<!-- md:version 5.0.0 -->
<!-- md:flag customization -->

Material for MkDocs includes an announcement bar, which is the perfect place to
display project news or other important information to the user. When the user
scrolls past the header, the bar will automatically disappear. In order to add
an announcement bar, [extend the theme] and [override the `announce`
block][overriding blocks], which is empty by default:

``` html
{% extends "base.html" %}

{% block announce %}
  <!-- Add announcement here, including arbitrary HTML -->
{% endblock %}
```

  [extend the theme]: ../customization.md#extending-the-theme
  [overriding blocks]: ../customization.md#overriding-blocks

#### Mark as read

<!-- md:version 8.4.0 -->
<!-- md:feature -->
<!-- md:flag experimental -->

In order to render temporary announcements that can be marked as read by the
user, a button to dismiss the current announcement can be included. Add the
following lines to `mkdocs.yml`:

``` yaml
theme:
  features:
    - announce.dismiss
```

When the user clicks the button, the current announcement is dismissed and not
displayed again until the content of the announcement changes. This is handled
automatically.

[Scroll to the top of this page][top] to see it in action.

  [top]: #


# Setting up the footer

The footer of your project documentation is a great place to add links to
websites or platforms you or your company are using as additional marketing
channels, e.g. :fontawesome-brands-mastodon:{ style="color: #5A4CE0" } or
:fontawesome-brands-youtube:{ style="color: #EE0F0F" }, which you can easily
configure via `mkdocs.yml`.

## Configuration

### Navigation

<!-- md:version 9.0.0 -->
<!-- md:feature -->

The footer can include links to the previous and next page of the current page.
If you wish to enable this behavior, add the following lines to `mkdocs.yml`:

``` yaml
theme:
  features:
    - navigation.footer
```

### Social links

<!-- md:version 1.0.0 -->
<!-- md:default none -->

Social links are rendered next to the copyright notice as part of the
footer of your project documentation. Add a list of social links in `mkdocs.yml`
with:

``` yaml
extra:
  social:
    - icon: fontawesome/brands/mastodon # (1)!
      link: https://fosstodon.org/@squidfunk
```

1.  Enter a few keywords to find the perfect icon using our [icon search] and
    click on the shortcode to copy it to your clipboard:

    <div class="mdx-iconsearch" data-mdx-component="iconsearch">
      <input class="md-input md-input--stretch mdx-iconsearch__input" placeholder="Search icon" data-mdx-component="iconsearch-query" value="mastodon" />
      <div class="mdx-iconsearch-result" data-mdx-component="iconsearch-result" data-mdx-mode="file">
        <div class="mdx-iconsearch-result__meta"></div>
        <ol class="mdx-iconsearch-result__list"></ol>
      </div>
    </div>

The following properties are available for each link:

<!-- md:option social.icon -->

:   <!-- md:default none --> <!-- md:flag required -->
    This property must contain a valid path to any icon bundled with the theme,
    or the build will not succeed. Some popular choices:

    * :fontawesome-brands-github: – `fontawesome/brands/github`
    * :fontawesome-brands-gitlab: – `fontawesome/brands/gitlab`
    * :fontawesome-brands-x-twitter: – `fontawesome/brands/x-twitter`
    * :fontawesome-brands-mastodon: – `fontawesome/brands/mastodon`
      <small>automatically adds [`rel=me`][rel=me]</small>
    * :fontawesome-brands-docker: – `fontawesome/brands/docker`
    * :fontawesome-brands-facebook: – `fontawesome/brands/facebook`
    * :fontawesome-brands-instagram: – `fontawesome/brands/instagram`
    * :fontawesome-brands-linkedin: – `fontawesome/brands/linkedin`
    * :fontawesome-brands-slack: – `fontawesome/brands/slack`
    * :fontawesome-brands-discord: – `fontawesome/brands/discord`
    * :fontawesome-brands-pied-piper-alt: – `fontawesome/brands/pied-piper-alt`

<!-- md:option social.link -->

:   <!-- md:default none --> <!-- md:flag required -->
    This property must be set to a relative or absolute URL including the URI
    scheme. All URI schemes are supported, including `mailto` and `bitcoin`:

    === ":fontawesome-brands-mastodon: Mastodon"

        ``` yaml
        extra:
          social:
            - icon: fontawesome/brands/mastodon
              link: https://fosstodon.org/@squidfunk
        ```

    === ":octicons-mail-16: Email"

        ``` yaml
        extra:
          social:
            - icon: fontawesome/solid/paper-plane
              link: mailto:<email-address>
        ```

<!-- md:option social.name -->

:   <!-- md:default _domain name from_ `link`_, if available_ -->
    This property is used as the link's `title` attribute and can be set to a
    discernable name to improve accessibility:

    ``` yaml
    extra:
      social:
        - icon: fontawesome/brands/mastodon
          link: https://fosstodon.org/@squidfunk
          name: squidfunk on Fosstodon
    ```

  [icon search]: ../reference/icons-emojis.md#search
  [rel=me]: https://docs.joinmastodon.org/user/profile/#verification

### Copyright notice

<!-- md:version 0.1.0 -->
<!-- md:default none -->

A custom copyright banner can be rendered as part of the footer, which is
displayed next to the social links. It can be defined as part of `mkdocs.yml`:

``` yaml
copyright: Copyright &copy; 2016 - 2020 Martin Donath
```

### Generator notice

<!-- md:version 7.3.0 -->
<!-- md:default `true` -->

The footer displays a _Made with Material for MkDocs_ notice to denote how
the site was generated. The notice can be removed with the following option
via `mkdocs.yml`:

``` yaml
extra:
  generator: false
```

!!! info "Please read this before removing the generator notice"

    The subtle __Made with Material for MkDocs__ hint in the footer is one of
    the reasons why this project is so popular, as it tells the user how the
    site is generated, helping new users to discover this project. Before
    removing please consider that you're enjoying the benefits of @squidfunk's
    work for free, as this project is Open Source and has a permissive license.
    Thousands of hours went into this project, most of them
    without any financial return.

    Thus, if you remove this notice, please consider [sponsoring][Insiders] the
    project. __Thank you__ :octicons-heart-fill-24:{ .mdx-heart .mdx-insiders }

  [Insiders]: ../insiders/index.md

## Usage

### Hiding prev/next links

The footer navigation showing links to the previous and next page can be hidden
with the front matter `hide` property. Add the following lines at the top of a
Markdown file:

``` yaml
---
hide:
  - footer
---

# Page title
...
```

## Customization

### Custom copyright

<!-- md:version 8.0.0 -->
<!-- md:flag customization -->

In order to customize and override the [copyright notice], [extend the theme]
and [override the `copyright.html` partial][overriding partials], which normally
includes the `copyright` property set in `mkdocs.yml`.

  [copyright notice]: #copyright-notice
  [generator notice]: #generator-notice
  [extend the theme]: ../customization.md#extending-the-theme
  [overriding partials]: ../customization.md#overriding-partials

# Extensions

Markdown is a very small language with a kind-of reference implementation called
[John Gruber's Markdown]. [Python Markdown] and [Python Markdown Extensions]
are two packages that enhance the Markdown writing experience, adding useful
syntax extensions for technical writing.

  [John Gruber's Markdown]: https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/
  [Python Markdown]: python-markdown.md
  [Python Markdown Extensions]: python-markdown-extensions.md

## Supported extensions

The following extensions are all supported by Material for MkDocs and therefore
strongly recommended. Click on each extension to learn about its purpose and
configuration:

  [Tables]: python-markdown.md#tables
  [Tasklist]: python-markdown-extensions.md#tasklist

## Configuration

Extensions are configured as part of `mkdocs.yml` – the MkDocs configuration
file. The following sections contain two example configurations to bootstrap
your documentation project.

  [overview]: #advanced-configuration

### Minimal configuration

This configuration is a good starting point for when you're using Material for
MkDocs for the first time. The best idea is to explore the [reference], and
gradually add what you want to use:

``` yaml
markdown_extensions:

  # Python Markdown
  - toc:
      permalink: true

  # Python Markdown Extensions
  - pymdownx.highlight
  - pymdownx.superfences
```

  [reference]: ../../reference/index.md

### Recommended configuration

This configuration enables all Markdown-related features of Material for MkDocs
and is great for experienced users bootstrapping a new documentation project:

``` yaml
markdown_extensions:

  # Python Markdown
  - abbr
  - admonition
  - attr_list
  - def_list
  - footnotes
  - md_in_html
  - toc:
      permalink: true

  # Python Markdown Extensions
  - pymdownx.arithmatex:
      generic: true
  - pymdownx.betterem:
      smart_enable: all
  - pymdownx.caret
  - pymdownx.details
  - pymdownx.emoji:
      emoji_index: !!python/name:material.extensions.emoji.twemoji
      emoji_generator: !!python/name:material.extensions.emoji.to_svg
  - pymdownx.highlight
  - pymdownx.inlinehilite
  - pymdownx.keys
  - pymdownx.mark
  - pymdownx.smartsymbols
  - pymdownx.superfences
  - pymdownx.tabbed:
      alternate_style: true
  - pymdownx.tasklist:
      custom_checkbox: true
  - pymdownx.tilde
```


# Python Markdown

Material for MkDocs supports a large number of [Python Markdown] extensions,
which is part of what makes it so attractive for technical writing. Following
is a list of all supported extensions, linking to the relevant sections of the
reference for which features they need to be enabled.

  [Python Markdown]: https://python-markdown.github.io/

## Supported extensions

### Abbreviations

<!-- md:version 1.0.0 -->
<!-- md:extension [abbr][Abbreviations] -->

The [Abbreviations] extension adds the ability to add a small tooltip to an
element, by wrapping it with an `abbr` tag. Only plain text (no markup) is
supported. Enable it via `mkdocs.yml`:

``` yaml
markdown_extensions:
  - abbr
```

No configuration options are available. See reference for usage:

- [Adding abbreviations]

### Admonition

<!-- md:version 0.1.0 -->
<!-- md:extension [admonition][Admonition] -->

The [Admonition] extension adds support for admonitions, more commonly known as
_call-outs_, which can be defined in Markdown by using a simple syntax. Enable
it via `mkdocs.yml`:

``` yaml
markdown_extensions:
  - admonition
```

No configuration options are available. See reference for usage:

- [Adding admonitions]
- [Changing the title]
- [Removing the title]

  [Changing the title]: ../../reference/admonitions.md#changing-the-title
  [Removing the title]: ../../reference/admonitions.md#removing-the-title
  [Supported types]: ../../reference/admonitions.md#supported-types

### Attribute Lists

<!-- md:version 0.1.0 -->
<!-- md:extension [attr_list][Attribute Lists] -->

The [Attribute Lists] extension allows to add HTML attributes and CSS classes
to [almost every][Attribute Lists limitations] Markdown inline- and block-level
element with a special syntax. Enable it via `mkdocs.yml`:

``` yaml
markdown_extensions:
  - attr_list
```

No configuration options are available. See reference for usage:

- [Using annotations]
- [Using grids]
- [Adding buttons]
- [Adding tooltips]
- [Using icons with colors]
- [Using icons with animations]
- [Image alignment]
- [Image lazy-loading]

  [Attribute Lists]: https://python-markdown.github.io/extensions/attr_list/
  [Attribute Lists limitations]: https://python-markdown.github.io/extensions/attr_list/#limitations

  [Image lazy-loading]: ../../reference/images.md#image-lazy-loading

### Definition Lists

<!-- md:version 1.1.0 -->
<!-- md:extension [def_list][Definition Lists] -->

The [Definition Lists] extension adds the ability to add definition lists (more
commonly known as [description lists] – `dl` in HTML) via Markdown to a
document. Enable it via `mkdocs.yml`:

``` yaml
markdown_extensions:
  - def_list
```

No configuration options are available. See reference for usage:

- [Using definition lists]

  [Definition Lists]: https://python-markdown.github.io/extensions/definition_lists/
  [description lists]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dl
  [Using definition lists]: ../../reference/lists.md#using-definition-lists

### Footnotes

<!-- md:version 1.0.0 -->
<!-- md:extension [footnotes][Footnotes] -->

The [Footnotes] extension allows to define inline footnotes, which are then
rendered below all Markdown content of a document. Enable it via `mkdocs.yml`:

``` yaml
markdown_extensions:
  - footnotes
```

No configuration options are supported. See reference for usage:

- [Adding footnote references]
- [Adding footnote content]

  [Footnotes]: https://python-markdown.github.io/extensions/footnotes/
  [Adding footnote references]: ../../reference/footnotes.md#adding-footnote-references
  [Adding footnote content]: ../../reference/footnotes.md#adding-footnote-content

### Markdown in HTML

<!-- md:version 0.1.0 -->
<!-- md:extension [md_in_html][Markdown in HTML] -->

The [Markdown in HTML] extension allows for writing Markdown inside of HTML,
which is useful for wrapping Markdown content with custom elements. Enable it
via `mkdocs.yml`:

``` yaml
markdown_extensions:
  - md_in_html
```

> By default, Markdown ignores any content within a raw HTML block-level
> element. With the `md_in_html` extension enabled, the content of a raw HTML
> block-level element can be parsed as Markdown by including a `markdown`
> attribute on the opening tag. The `markdown` attribute will be stripped from
> the output, while all other attributes will be preserved.

No configuration options are available. See reference for usage:

- [Using annotations]
- [Using grids]
- [Image captions]

  [Markdown in HTML]: https://python-markdown.github.io/extensions/md_in_html/
  [Using annotations]: ../../reference/annotations.md#usage
  [Using grids]: ../../reference/grids.md#usage
  [Image captions]: ../../reference/images.md#image-captions

### Table of Contents

<!-- md:version 0.1.0 -->
<!-- md:extension [toc][Table of Contents] -->

The [Table of Contents] extension automatically generates a table of contents
from a document, which Material for MkDocs will render as part of the resulting
page. Enable it via `mkdocs.yml`:

``` yaml
markdown_extensions:
  - toc:
      permalink: true
```

The following configuration options are supported:

<!-- md:option toc.title -->

:   <!-- md:version 7.3.5 --> <!-- md:default computed --> –
    This option sets the title of the table of contents in the right navigation
    sidebar, which is normally automatically sourced from the translations for
    the [site language] as set in `mkdocs.yml`:

    ``` yaml
    markdown_extensions:
      - toc:
          title: On this page
    ```

<!-- md:option toc.permalink -->

:   <!-- md:default `false` --> This option adds an anchor link
    containing the paragraph symbol `¶` or another custom symbol at the end of
    each headline, exactly like on the page you're currently viewing, which
    Material for MkDocs will make appear on hover:

    === "¶"

        ``` yaml
        markdown_extensions:
          - toc:
              permalink: true
        ```

    === "⚓︎"

        ``` yaml
        markdown_extensions:
          - toc:
              permalink: ⚓︎
        ```

<!-- md:option toc.permalink_title -->

:   <!-- md:default `Permanent link` --> This option sets the
    title of the anchor link which is shown on hover and read by screen readers.
    For accessibility reasons, it might be beneficial to change it to a more
    discernable name, stating that the anchor links to the section itself:

    ``` yaml
    markdown_extensions:
      - toc:
          permalink_title: Anchor link to this section for reference
    ```

<!-- md:option toc.slugify -->

:   <!-- md:default `toc.slugify` --> This option allows for
    customization of the slug function. For some languages, the default may not
    produce good and readable identifiers – consider using another slug function
    like for example those from [Python Markdown Extensions][Slugs]:

    === "Unicode"

        ``` yaml
        markdown_extensions:
          - toc:
              slugify: !!python/object/apply:pymdownx.slugs.slugify
                kwds:
                  case: lower
        ```

    === "Unicode, case-sensitive"

        ``` yaml
        markdown_extensions:
          - toc:
              slugify: !!python/object/apply:pymdownx.slugs.slugify {}
        ```

<!-- md:option toc.toc_depth -->

:   <!-- md:default `6` --> Define the range of levels to be
    included in the table of contents. This may be useful for project
    documentation with deeply structured headings to decrease the length of the
    table of contents, or to remove the table of contents altogether:

    === "Hide levels 4-6"

        ``` yaml
        markdown_extensions:
          - toc:
              toc_depth: 3
        ```

    === "Hide table of contents"

        ``` yaml
        markdown_extensions:
          - toc:
              toc_depth: 0
        ```

The other configuration options of this extension are not officially supported
by Material for MkDocs, which is why they may yield unexpected results. Use
them at your own risk.

  [Slugs]: https://facelessuser.github.io/pymdown-extensions/extras/slugs/

### Tables

<!-- md:version 0.1.0 -->
<!-- md:extension [tables][Tables] -->

The [Tables] extension adds the ability to create tables in Markdown by using a
simple syntax. Enable it via `mkdocs.yml` (albeit it should be enabled by
default):

``` yaml
markdown_extensions:
  - tables
```

No configuration options are available. See reference for usage:

- [Using data tables]
- [Column alignment]

  [Tables]: https://python-markdown.github.io/extensions/tables/
  [Using data tables]: ../../reference/data-tables.md#usage
  [Column alignment]: ../../reference/data-tables.md#column-alignment

## Superseded extensions

The following [Python Markdown] extensions are not (or might not be) supported
anymore, and are therefore not recommended for use. Instead, the alternatives
should be considered.

### Fenced Code Blocks

<!-- md:version 0.1.0 -->
<!-- md:extension [fenced_code_blocks][Fenced Code Blocks] -->

Superseded by [SuperFences]. This extension might still work, but the
[SuperFences] extension is superior in many ways, as it allows for arbitrary
nesting, and is therefore recommended.

  [Fenced Code Blocks]: https://python-markdown.github.io/extensions/fenced_code_blocks/
  [SuperFences]: https://facelessuser.github.io/pymdown-extensions/extensions/superfences/

### CodeHilite

<!-- md:version 0.1.0 -->
<!-- md:extension [codehilite][CodeHilite] -->

Superseded by [Highlight]. Support for CodeHilite was dropped in
<!-- md:version 6.0.0 -->, as [Highlight] has a better integration with other

# Python Markdown Extensions

The [Python Markdown Extensions] package is an excellent collection of
additional extensions perfectly suited for advanced technical writing. Material
for MkDocs lists this package as an explicit dependency, so it's automatically
installed with a supported version.

  [Python Markdown Extensions]: https://facelessuser.github.io/pymdown-extensions/

## Supported extensions

In general, all extensions that are part of [Python Markdown Extensions] should
work with Material for MkDocs. The following list includes all extensions that
are natively supported, meaning they work without any further adjustments.

### Arithmatex

<!-- md:version 1.0.0 -->
<!-- md:extension [pymdownx.arithmatex][Arithmatex] -->

The [Arithmatex] extension allows for rendering of block and inline block
equations and integrates seamlessly with [MathJax][^1] – a library for
mathematical typesetting. Enable it via `mkdocs.yml`:

  [^1]:
    Other libraries like [KaTeX] are also supported and can be integrated with
    some additional effort. See the [Arithmatex documentation on KaTeX] for
    further guidance, as this is beyond the scope of Material for MkDocs.

``` yaml
markdown_extensions:
  - pymdownx.arithmatex:
      generic: true
```

Besides enabling the extension in `mkdocs.yml`, a MathJax configuration and
the JavaScript runtime need to be included, which can be done with a few lines
of [additional JavaScript]:

=== ":octicons-file-code-16: `docs/javascripts/mathjax.js`"

    ``` js
    window.MathJax = {
      tex: {
        inlineMath: [["\\(", "\\)"]],
        displayMath: [["\\[", "\\]"]],
        processEscapes: true,
        processEnvironments: true
      },
      options: {
        ignoreHtmlClass: ".*|",
        processHtmlClass: "arithmatex"
      }
    };

    document$.subscribe(() => { // (1)!
      MathJax.startup.output.clearCache()
      MathJax.typesetClear()
      MathJax.texReset()
      MathJax.typesetPromise()
    })
    ```

    1. This integrates MathJax with [instant loading]


=== ":octicons-file-code-16: `mkdocs.yml`"

    ``` yaml
    extra_javascript:
      - javascripts/mathjax.js
      - https://unpkg.com/mathjax@3/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js
    ```

The other configuration options of this extension are not officially supported
by Material for MkDocs, which is why they may yield unexpected results. Use
them at your own risk.

### BetterEm

<!-- md:version 0.1.0 -->
<!-- md:extension [pymdownx.betterem][BetterEm] -->

The [BetterEm] extension improves the detection of Markup to emphasize text
in Markdown using special characters, i.e. for `**bold**` and `_italic_`
formatting. Enable it via `mkdocs.yml`:

``` yaml
markdown_extensions:
  - pymdownx.betterem
```

The configuration options of this extension are not specific to Material for
MkDocs, as they only impact the Markdown parsing stage. See the [BetterEm
documentation][BetterEm] for more information.

  [BetterEm]: https://facelessuser.github.io/pymdown-extensions/extensions/betterem/

### Caption

<!-- md:version 1.0.0 -->
<!-- md:extension [pymdownx.blocks.caption][Caption] -->

The [Caption] extension adds the ability to add captions to any Markdown block,
including images, tables, and code blocks. Enable it via `mkdocs.yml`:

``` yaml
markdown_extensions:
  - pymdownx.blocks.caption
```

The configuration options of this extension are not specific to Material for
MkDocs, as they only impact the Markdown parsing stage. See the [Caption
documentation][Caption] for more information.

  [Caption]: https://facelessuser.github.io/pymdown-extensions/extensions/blocks/plugins/caption/

### Caret, Mark & Tilde

<!-- md:version 1.0.0 -->
<!-- md:extension [pymdownx.caret][Caret] -->

The [Caret], [Mark] and [Tilde] extensions add the ability to highlight text
and define sub- and superscript using a simple syntax. Enable them together
via `mkdocs.yml`:

``` yaml
markdown_extensions:
  - pymdownx.caret
  - pymdownx.mark
  - pymdownx.tilde
```

The configuration options of this extension are not specific to Material for
MkDocs, as they only impact the Markdown parsing stage. See the [Caret], [Mark]
and [Tilde documentation][Tilde] for guidance.

  [Highlighting text]: ../../reference/formatting.md#highlighting-text
  [Sub- and superscripts]: ../../reference/formatting.md#sub-and-superscripts

### Critic

<!-- md:version 1.0.0 -->
<!-- md:extension [pymdownx.critic][Critic] -->

The [Critic] extension allows for the usage of [Critic Markup] to highlight
added, deleted or updated sections in a document, i.e. for tracking changes in
Markdown syntax. Enable it via `mkdocs.yml`:

``` yaml
markdown_extensions:
  - pymdownx.critic
```

The following configuration options are supported:

<!-- md:option pymdownx.critic.mode -->

:   <!-- md:default `view` --> This option defines how the markup
    should be parsed, i.e. whether to just `view` all suggested changes, or
    alternatively `accept` or `reject` them:

    === "View changes"

        ``` yaml
        markdown_extensions:
          - pymdownx.critic:
              mode: view
        ```

    === "Accept changes"

        ``` yaml
        markdown_extensions:
          - pymdownx.critic:
              mode: accept
        ```

    === "Reject changes"

        ``` yaml
        markdown_extensions:
          - pymdownx.critic:
              mode: reject
        ```

See reference for usage:

  [Critic]: https://facelessuser.github.io/pymdown-extensions/extensions/critic/
  [Critic Markup]: https://github.com/CriticMarkup/CriticMarkup-toolkit
  [Highlighting changes]: ../../reference/formatting.md#highlighting-changes

### Details

<!-- md:version 1.9.0 -->
<!-- md:extension [pymdownx.details][Details] -->

The [Details] extension supercharges the [Admonition] extension, making the
resulting _call-outs_ collapsible, allowing them to be opened and closed by the
user. Enable it via `mkdocs.yml`:

``` yaml
markdown_extensions:
  - pymdownx.details
```

No configuration options are available. See reference for usage:

- [Collapsible blocks]

  [Details]: https://facelessuser.github.io/pymdown-extensions/extensions/details/
  [Admonition]: python-markdown.md#admonition
  [Collapsible blocks]: ../../reference/admonitions.md#collapsible-blocks

### Emoji

<!-- md:version 1.0.0 -->
<!-- md:extension [pymdownx.emoji][Emoji] -->

The [Emoji] extension automatically inlines bundled and custom icons and emojis
in `*.svg` file format into the resulting HTML page. Enable it via `mkdocs.yml`:

``` yaml
markdown_extensions:
  - pymdownx.emoji:
      emoji_index: !!python/name:material.extensions.emoji.twemoji # (1)!
      emoji_generator: !!python/name:material.extensions.emoji.to_svg
```

1.  [Python Markdown Extensions] uses the `pymdownx` namespace, but in order to
    support the inlining of icons, the `materialx` namespace must be used, as it
    extends the functionality of `pymdownx`.

The following configuration options are supported:

<!-- md:option pymdownx.emoji.emoji_index -->

:   <!-- md:default `emojione` --> This option defines which set
    of emojis is used for rendering. Note that the use of `emojione` is not
    recommended due to [restrictions in licensing][Emoji index]:

    ``` yaml
    markdown_extensions:
      - pymdownx.emoji:
          emoji_index: !!python/name:material.extensions.emoji.twemoji
    ```

<!-- md:option pymdownx.emoji.emoji_generator -->

:   <!-- md:default `to_png` --> This option defines how the
    resolved emoji or icon shortcode is render. Note that icons can only be
    used together with the `to_svg` configuration:

    ``` yaml
    markdown_extensions:
      - pymdownx.emoji:
          emoji_generator: !!python/name:material.extensions.emoji.to_svg
    ```

<!-- md:option pymdownx.emoji.options.custom_icons -->

:   <!-- md:default none --> This option allows to list folders
    with additional icon sets to be used in Markdown or `mkdocs.yml`, which is
    explained in more detail in the [icon customization guide]:

    ``` yaml
    markdown_extensions:
      - pymdownx.emoji:
          emoji_index: !!python/name:material.extensions.emoji.twemoji
          emoji_generator: !!python/name:material.extensions.emoji.to_svg
          options:
            custom_icons:
              - overrides/.icons
    ```

The other configuration options of this extension are not officially supported
by Material for MkDocs, which is why they may yield unexpected results. Use
them at your own risk.

### Highlight

<!-- md:version 5.0.0 -->
<!-- md:extension [pymdownx.highlight][Highlight] -->

The [Highlight] extension adds support for syntax highlighting of code blocks
(with the help of [SuperFences][pymdownx.superfences]) and inline code blocks
(with the help of [InlineHilite][pymdownx.inlinehilite]). Enable it via
`mkdocs.yml`:

``` yaml
markdown_extensions:
  - pymdownx.highlight:
      anchor_linenums: true
  - pymdownx.superfences # (1)!
```

1.  [Highlight] is used by the [SuperFences][pymdownx.superfences] extension to
    perform syntax highlighting on code blocks, not the other way round, which
    is why this extension also needs to be enabled.

The following configuration options are supported:

<!-- md:option pymdownx.highlight.use_pygments -->

:   <!-- md:default `true` --> This option allows to control
    whether highlighting should be carried out during build time using
    [Pygments] or in the browser with a JavaScript syntax highlighter:

    === "Pygments"

        ``` yaml
        markdown_extensions:
          - pymdownx.highlight:
              use_pygments: true
          - pymdownx.superfences
        ```

    === "JavaScript"

        ``` yaml
        markdown_extensions:
          - pymdownx.highlight:
              use_pygments: false
        ```

        As an example, [Highlight.js], a JavaScript syntax highlighter, can be
        integrated with some [additional JavaScript] and an [additional style
        sheet] in `mkdocs.yml`:

        === ":octicons-file-code-16: `docs/javascripts/highlight.js`"

            ``` js
            document$.subscribe(() => {
              hljs.highlightAll()
            })
            ```

        === ":octicons-file-code-16: `mkdocs.yml`"

            ``` yaml
            extra_javascript:
              - https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/10.7.2/highlight.min.js
              - javascripts/highlight.js
            extra_css:
              - https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/10.7.2/styles/default.min.css
            ```

        Note that [Highlight.js] has no affiliation with the
        [Highlight][pymdownx.highlight] extension.

    All following configuration options are only compatible with build-time
    syntax highlighting using [Pygments], so they don't apply if `use_pygments`
    is set to `false`.

<!-- md:option pymdownx.highlight.pygments_lang_class -->

:   <!-- md:default `false` --> This option instructs [Pygments]
    to add a CSS class to identify the language of the code block, which is
    essential for custom annotation markers to function:

``` yaml
markdown_extensions:
  - pymdownx.highlight:
      pygments_lang_class: true
```

<!-- md:option pymdownx.highlight.auto_title -->

:   <!-- md:default `false` --> This option will automatically
    add a [title] to all code blocks that shows the name of the language being
    used, e.g. `Python` is printed for a `py` block:

    ``` yaml
    markdown_extensions:
      - pymdownx.highlight:
          auto_title: true
    ```

<!-- md:option pymdownx.highlight.linenums -->

:   <!-- md:default `false` --> This option will add line numbers
    to _all_ code blocks. If you wish to add line numbers to _some_, but not all
    code blocks, consult the section on [adding line numbers][Adding line
    numbers] in the code block reference, which also contains some tips on
    working with line numbers:

    ``` yaml
    markdown_extensions:
      - pymdownx.highlight:
          linenums: true
    ```

<!-- md:option pymdownx.highlight.linenums_style -->

:   <!-- md:default `table` --> The [Highlight] extension
    provides three ways to add line numbers, two of which are supported by
    Material for MkDocs. While `table` wraps a code block in a `<table>`
    element, `pymdownx-inline` renders line numbers as part of the line itself:

    ``` yaml
    markdown_extensions:
      - pymdownx.highlight:
          linenums_style: pymdownx-inline
    ```

    Note that `inline` will put line numbers next to the actual code, which
    means that they will be included when selecting text with the cursor or
    copying a code block to the clipboard. Thus, the usage of either `table`
    or `pymdownx-inline` is recommended.

<!-- md:option pymdownx.highlight.anchor_linenums -->

:   <!-- md:version 8.1.0 --> :octicons-milestone-24:
    Default: `false` – If a code blocks contains line numbers, enabling this
    setting will wrap them with anchor links, so they can be hyperlinked and
    shared more easily:

    ``` yaml
    markdown_extensions:
      - pymdownx.highlight:
          anchor_linenums: true
    ```

<!-- md:option pymdownx.highlight.line_spans -->

:   <!-- md:default none --> When this option is set, each
    line of a code block is wrapped in a `span`, which is essential for features
    like line highlighting to work correctly:

    ``` yaml
    markdown_extensions:
      - pymdownx.highlight:
          line_spans: __span
    ```

The other configuration options of this extension are not officially supported
by Material for MkDocs, which is why they may yield unexpected results. Use
them at your own risk.

### InlineHilite

<!-- md:version 5.0.0 -->
<!-- md:extension [pymdownx.inlinehilite][InlineHilite] -->

The [InlineHilite] extension add support for syntax highlighting of inline code
blocks. It's built on top of the [Highlight][pymdownx.highlight] extension, from
which it sources its configuration. Enable it via `mkdocs.yml`:

``` yaml
markdown_extensions:
  - pymdownx.highlight
  - pymdownx.inlinehilite
```

The configuration options of this extension are not specific to Material for
MkDocs, as they only impact the Markdown parsing stage. The only exception is
the [`css_class`][InlineHilite options] option, which must not be changed. See the
[InlineHilite documentation][InlineHilite] for guidance.

### Keys

<!-- md:version 1.0.0 -->
<!-- md:extension [pymdownx.keys][Keys] -->

The [Keys] extension adds a simple syntax to allow for the rendering of keyboard
keys and combinations, e.g. ++ctrl+alt+del++. Enable it via `mkdocs.yml`:

``` yaml
markdown_extensions:
  - pymdownx.keys
```

The configuration options of this extension are not specific to Material for
MkDocs, as they only impact the Markdown parsing stage. The only exception is
the [`class`][Keys options] option, which must not be changed. See the
[Keys documentation][Keys] for more information.

### SmartSymbols

<!-- md:version 0.1.0 -->
<!-- md:extension [pymdownx.smartsymbols][SmartSymbols] -->

The [SmartSymbols] extension converts some sequences of characters into their
corresponding symbols, e.g. copyright symbols or fractions. Enable it via
`mkdocs.yml`:

``` yaml
markdown_extensions:
  - pymdownx.smartsymbols
```

The configuration options of this extension are not specific to Material for
MkDocs, as they only impact the Markdown parsing stage. See the [SmartSymbols
documentation][SmartSymbols] for guidance.

  [SmartSymbols]: https://facelessuser.github.io/pymdown-extensions/extensions/smartsymbols/

### Snippets

<!-- md:version 0.1.0 -->
<!-- md:extension [pymdownx.snippets][Snippets] -->

The [Snippets] extension adds the ability to embed content from arbitrary files
into a document, including other documents or source files, by using a simple
syntax. Enable it via `mkdocs.yml`:

``` yaml
markdown_extensions:
  - pymdownx.snippets
```

The configuration options of this extension are not specific to Material for
MkDocs, as they only impact the Markdown parsing stage. See the [Snippets
documentation][Snippets] for more information.

  [Adding a glossary]: ../../reference/tooltips.md#adding-a-glossary
  [Embedding external files]: ../../reference/code-blocks.md#embedding-external-files

### SuperFences

<!-- md:version 0.1.0 -->
<!-- md:extension [pymdownx.superfences][SuperFences] -->

The [SuperFences] extension allows for arbitrary nesting of code and content
blocks inside each other, including admonitions, tabs, lists and all other
elements. Enable it via `mkdocs.yml`:

``` yaml
markdown_extensions:
  - pymdownx.superfences
```

The following configuration options are supported:

<!-- md:option pymdownx.superfences.custom_fences -->

:   <!-- md:default none --> This option allows to define a
    handler for custom fences, e.g. to preserve the definitions of [Mermaid.js]
    diagrams to be interpreted in the browser:

    ``` yaml
    markdown_extensions:
      - pymdownx.superfences:
          custom_fences:
            - name: mermaid
              class: mermaid
              format: !!python/name:pymdownx.superfences.fence_code_format
    ```

    Note that this will primarily prevent syntax highlighting from being
    applied. See the reference on [diagrams] to learn how Mermaid.js is
    integrated with Material for MkDocs.

The other configuration options of this extension are not officially supported
by Material for MkDocs, which is why they may yield unexpected results. Use
them at your own risk.

### Tabbed

<!-- md:version 5.0.0 -->
<!-- md:extension [pymdownx.tabbed][Tabbed] -->

The [Tabbed] extension allows the usage of content tabs, a simple way to group
related content and code blocks under accessible tabs. Enable it via
`mkdocs.yml`:

``` yaml
markdown_extensions:
  - pymdownx.tabbed:
      alternate_style: true
```

The following configuration options are supported:

<!-- md:option pymdownx.tabbed.alternate_style -->

:   <!-- md:version 7.3.1 --> <!-- md:default `false` -->
    <!-- md:flag required -->  This option enables the content tabs
    [alternate style], which has [better behavior on mobile viewports], and is
    the only supported style:

    ``` yaml
    markdown_extensions:
      - pymdownx.tabbed:
          alternate_style: true
    ```

<!-- md:option pymdownx.tabbed.combine_header_slug -->

:   <!-- md:default `false` --> This option enables the content tabs'
    [`combine_header_slug` style] flag, which prepends the id of the header to
    the id of the tab:

    ``` yaml
    markdown_extensions:
      - pymdownx.tabbed:
          combine_header_slug: true
    ```

<!-- md:option pymdownx.tabbed.slugify -->

:   <!-- md:default `None` --> This option allows for
    customization of the slug function. For some languages, the default may not
    produce good and readable identifiers – consider using another slug function
    like for example those from [Python Markdown Extensions][Slugs]:

    === "Unicode"

        ``` yaml
        markdown_extensions:
          - pymdownx.tabbed:
              slugify: !!python/object/apply:pymdownx.slugs.slugify
                kwds:
                  case: lower
        ```

    === "Unicode, case-sensitive"

        ``` yaml
        markdown_extensions:
          - pymdownx.tabbed:
              slugify: !!python/object/apply:pymdownx.slugs.slugify {}
        ```

The other configuration options of this extension are not officially supported
by Material for MkDocs, which is why they may yield unexpected results. Use
them at your own risk.

### Tasklist

<!-- md:version 1.0.0 -->
<!-- md:extension [pymdownx.tasklist][Tasklist] -->

The [Tasklist] extension allows for the usage of [GitHub Flavored Markdown]
inspired [task lists][Tasklist specification], following the same syntactical
conventions. Enable it via `mkdocs.yml`:

``` yaml
markdown_extensions:
  - pymdownx.tasklist:
      custom_checkbox: true
```

The following configuration options are supported:

<!-- md:option pymdownx.tasklist.custom_checkbox -->

:   <!-- md:default `false` --> This option toggles the rendering
    style of checkboxes, replacing native checkbox styles with beautiful icons,
    and is therefore recommended:

    ``` yaml
    markdown_extensions:
      - pymdownx.tasklist:
          custom_checkbox: true
    ```

<!-- md:option pymdownx.tasklist.clickable_checkbox -->

:   <!-- md:default `false` --> This option toggles whether
    checkboxes are clickable. As the state is not persisted, the use of this
    option is _rather discouraged_ from a user experience perspective:

    ``` yaml
    markdown_extensions:
      - pymdownx.tasklist:
          clickable_checkbox: true
    ```

The other configuration options of this extension are not officially supported
by Material for MkDocs, which is why they may yield unexpected results. Use
them at your own risk.
